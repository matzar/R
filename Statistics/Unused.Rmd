# Abstract

In this paper a full analysis of the gathered data will be presented, including data: preparation, analysis, exploration and interpretation; calculation of confidence intervals, interpretation of the results using different kinds of graphs and an explanation of the methods used.

# Introduction

Recent evidence has shown as undergraduate students progress through their studies their reasons for learning change; their primary focus shifts from deep understanding of the subject towards achieving good grades.

The goal of the survey was to find out if the hypothesis stated in the abstract is true.
The authors of the survey stated a hypothesis that - as students progress through their studies their reasons for learning change; their primary focus shifts from achieving good grades towards deep understanding of the subject. The authors wanted to inspect if the student's subject, age and sex would influence, otherwise independent, results.

Recent evidence has shown that undergraduate students tend to have different reasons for studying as they progress through their course. In this paper, we seek to answer whether this is true while also taking into consideration a studentâ€™s `subject`, `sex` and a `year` of study. 

The goal of the survey was to find out if the hypothesis stated in the abstract is true.
The authors of the survey stated a hypothesis that - as students progress through their studies their reasons for learning change; their primary focus shifts from achieving good grades towards deep understanding of the subject. The authors wanted to inspect if the student's subject, age and sex would influence, otherwise independent, results.

The survey had 15 questions which were designed to explore 7 main areas of interest, which were student's: 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
