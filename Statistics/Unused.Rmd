The graph below shows the *Importance focus (MG)* category mean results. All the students are represented; student's sex was made distinguishable by a colour and student's studied subject by a shape.






Visual investigation of ratios between sexes and subjects shows that, apart from a visible difference in the amount of Accounnting students, there is really no big differences between 

We we are going to find out if, and how many students are at risk of developing mental health issues and test the hypothesis 1) and 2) set on basis of sex and subject.

# Abstract
*This should be a very brief explanation of your research paper (around 150 words). It normally includes information about the issue, why you are interested in that issue, your method/model, analysis results, discussions and conclusions.*

In this paper a full analysis of the gathered data will be presented, including data: preparation, analysis, exploration and interpretation; calculation of confidence intervals, interpretation of the results using different kinds of graphs and an explanation of the methods used.

# Introduction
*This section should explain the topic, why it is important, and how you approach the issue*

This is also a reason why many universities offer counseling for their students but it might not be enough. 

This paper does not aim to analyse the suicide rate and why it has been rising. Instead, maybe we can draw some conclusions based on the students' pursue of grades vs. understanding; how positive about the course they are and if wheater

> In Massachusetts, 214 students between the ages of 18 and 24 died by suicide between 2007 and 2016, according to state public health records. That’s a 43 percent increase from the prior decade.

If we could better understand which students are more exposed to experince such traumas we might be able to help them better. We might think that the data collected and presented in this paper by no means could help us undersatnd and prevent such tragedies. But maybe behind such simple things like student's overall enjoyment of the course, expectations of the subject to be interesting and their focus on deeper understadning vs. grades might be an indicator of their mental health. If the student is very negative about their course, they might feel that at their age they should have been long after the graduation, 

We will conduct the data analysis to the best of our capabilities but bear it mind, it does not exhaust the subject. A lot more can be done to help students and to prevent such tragedies.

, an understanding of the data set and its arrangement, was needed. 

Maybe while looking at the data we should also think that these are actual people and might want to first think how we could help them. 

# Data

**A formal analysis started with data exploration and interpretion of the 7 assessment categories, based on the questions they consisted of.**

| Category | Questions |
| -------- | --------- |
| Performance approach questions | - 1. It is important to me to be better than other students. - 2. It is important to me to do well compared to others in my courses - 3. My goal in my courses is to get a better grade than most of the other students. |
| Performance avoidance questions | 4. I just want to avoid doing poorly in my courses. 5. My fear of performing poorly is often what motivates me 6. My goal in this class is to avoid performing poorly |
| Mastery-Approach | 7. I want to learn as much as possible from all my courses. 8. I desire to completely master the material presented in my courses. 9. It is important for me to understand the content of my courses as thoroughly as possible |
| Mastery-Avoidance | 10. I worry that I may not learn all that I possibly could in my classes. 11. Sometimes I’m afraid that I may not understand the content of this course as thoroughly as I’d like. 12. I am often concerned that I may not learn all there is to learn in this class |
Table: 

After the questions have been randomised they kept their original numbering. In order to analyse the data, the question had to be derandomised. 

Recent evidence has shown as undergraduate students progress through their studies their reasons for learning change; their primary focus shifts from deep understanding of the subject towards achieving good grades.

The goal of the survey was to find out if the hypothesis stated in the abstract is true.
The authors of the survey stated a hypothesis that - as students progress through their studies their reasons for learning change; their primary focus shifts from achieving good grades towards deep understanding of the subject. The authors wanted to inspect if the student's subject, age and sex would influence, otherwise independent, results.

Recent evidence has shown that undergraduate students tend to have different reasons for studying as they progress through their course. In this paper, we seek to answer whether this is true while also taking into consideration a student’s `subject`, `sex` and a `year` of study.

The survey had 15 questions which were designed to explore 7 main areas of interest, which were student's:

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Our 95% confidence interval for the percentage of times we will get a student with a mean of
