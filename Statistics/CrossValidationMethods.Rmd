Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(magrittr)
```

Set things up for examples
```{r}
set.seed(1234)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Regression
Here we will examine the relationship between horsepower and car mileage in the Auto dataset (found in library(ISLR)):
```{r}
library(ISLR)

Auto <- as_tibble(Auto)
Auto
```

```{r}
ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

The relationship does not appear to be strictly linear:
```{r}
ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)
```


```{r}

```
