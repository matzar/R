## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a *document* will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(magrittr)
```

```{r}
# set seed for randomization to ensure that results are always reproduced precisely
set.seed(1234)
```

```{r}
# read csv file (worse variable recognition)
f <- "data/StudentGoalsData.csv"
StudentGoalsData <- read_csv(f)
```

```{r}
# drop 'seq' column since it doesn't serve any purpose
StudentGoalsData <- StudentGoalsData  %>%  ungroup  %>%  select(-seq)
```

```{r}
# count all the students before cleaning and dropping the data
n <- tally(StudentGoalsData)
```

```{r}
# # clean data - drop results contaiting empty cells
CleanedStudentGoalsData <- drop_na(StudentGoalsData)
```

```{r}
# write cleaned data to a file
write_csv(CleanedStudentGoalsData, "data/CleanedStudentGoalsData.csv")
```

```{r}

```
